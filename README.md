# conditional-average-for-channel-flow

This repository provides codes for finding conditionally averaged structures in channel flow based on different detection criteria. The codes are designed to run in multiple cores for parallel computing. 

Code 'calculate_3d_parallel_NonTp.m' calculates the conditonally averaged structures based on nonlinear transfer events. The events are further categorised into positive nonlinear transfer events and negative nonlinear transfer events.

Code 'calculate_3d_parallel_swirling2d.m' calculates the conditionally averaged structures based on two-dimensional swirling strength (you can choose streamwise, spanwise or wall-normal).
